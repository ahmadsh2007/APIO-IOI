# 📜 APIO 2025 Rules & Clarifications Summary

## ✅ What You *Can* Do:
- Use **books or notes you wrote before** the contest.
- Search the internet for **syntax or how specific tools work** (e.g., how `std::string::substr` works).
- Use your own **prewritten code**.
- Use **official documentation**, like cppreference, for language help.
- Search how to **implement an algorithm** (e.g., “Dijkstra with priority_queue”) **after deciding** on the algorithm independently.

## ❌ What You *Cannot* Do:
- Search **how to solve the problem**.
- Look up **similar problems** or **tutorials** online.
- Use **AI tools** (like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.).
- Ask for help or discuss problems **with anyone**.
- Copy code from **online sources**, even with modifications.
- Search for **strategies or approaches** like “how to solve tree queries.”

## 🤔 Key Guideline:
> If you’re searching for **how the tool/algorithm works**, it’s allowed.  
> If you’re searching for **how to solve the problem**, it’s not.

## 📌 Examples of Allowed Searches:
- “C++ priority_queue usage”
- “Binary exponentiation code”
- “Segment tree lazy propagation C++”
- “Dijkstra with adjacency list”

## 🚫 Examples of Not Allowed Searches:
- “Best way to solve tree problems”
- “Shortest path problem tutorial”
- “Codeforces problem 123 solution”
- “How to solve APIO 2025 problem A”

---

## ✅ Using the Competitive Programmer's Handbook:
Allowed **only as a reference**, e.g., for:
- Syntax
- Definitions
- Reminders of known techniques

**Not allowed** if using it as a tutorial to figure out how to solve the problem during the contest.

---

## 🛠 General Advice:
- Prepare your **own reference material** ahead of time.
- Study common algorithms so you don’t need to search for strategy.
- Use the internet only as a **technical manual**, not a tutor.
